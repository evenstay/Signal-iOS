• Saint Patrick's Day was so last month, so we added a workaround for an iOS bug that occasionally causes a green square to appear after pasting an image.
• We squashed another bug that prevented you from saving multiple images to your camera roll in messages that included an album.
• And we also fixed a crash that could happen after trying to share a call link on your iPad, so you don't need to pick up your phone in order to make a new call.
