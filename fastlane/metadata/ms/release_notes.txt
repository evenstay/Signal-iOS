• Blocked contacts will no longer show up in your contact list, recipient lists for sending messages or adding to a group, and more.  
• If a blocked contact adds you to a group, you’ll automatically leave that group. 
• Users with Speak Selection enabled can long press a text and select “Speak” to hear the text message read aloud. Thank you to our open source community for this accessibility feature!
